# StrikeGroupGame

## Notes on Goals:

This game will allow the user to control a group of ships (Carrier Strike Group, USN) through a dangerous strait of water.
The focus will be on dealing with contacts that will come up by random role (random number generator). With each encounter, the user will go into a minigame that they will have to win in order to progress with the greater narrative. We will be using Python and Pygame as the principal elements. We will also have separate windows to take information from the user, as well as basic sounds to go along with the game.

## Libraries used:
Pygame (Game_Logic)
Pydub (Sound_Effects)
Tkinter (Interactive_User_Elements)
